I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher at Samsung Research working on multimodal AI, conversational agents, and machine translation. In my six years of industry experience, I've worked in numerous roles that span from software engineering to data science for products that reach millions of users worldwide. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science *cum laude* from the University of the Philippines - Los Ba√±os and continued my research in the industry where I also mentor and teach others.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, particularly:
- **Generative Methods for Low-Resource Tasks**: Tasks such as machine translation and scene text recognition have established datasets for high-resource cases; however, I wish to address the question of whether existing generative models are able to generate synthetic data for low-resource cases in these problems.
- **Vision-Language Models**: While LLMs are capable of tasks such as conversation, question-answering, etc., agents must be able to also process other forms of input from the real world, particularly visual data such as images and video; as such, I am particularly interested in exploring the capabilities of VLMs as agents that can reason and plan using real world visual input.
- **Deep Learning Applications**: At Samsung, I am always on the lookout for ways to use recent advances in deep learning to improve user experience. This has currently resulted in two patent applications.
