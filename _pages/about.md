I’m currently an ML Research Engineer at Samsung Research working on conversational agents and machine translation. In my six years of industry experience, I’ve worked in numerous roles that span from software engineering to data science for products that reach millions of users worldwide. I earned my bachelor’s degree from the University of the Philippines - Los Baños and continued my research in the industry where I also mentor and teach others.

My research is in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing where I focus on generative methods for low-resource tasks such as scene text recognition for low-resource scripts and machine translation. I am also dipping my toes into multimodal models particularly vision-language models. You can reach out to me via [email](mailto:anton.rufino1125@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonrufino/) if you’re interested in talking about image generation, multimodality, and vision language models!
