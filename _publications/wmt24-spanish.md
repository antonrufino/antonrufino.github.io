This paper details the submission of Samsung R&D Institute Philippines (SRPH) Language Intelligence Team (LIT) to the WMT 2024 Low-resource Languages of Spain shared task. We trained translation models for Spanish to Aragonese, Spanish to Aranese/Occitan, and Spanish to Asturian using a standard sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture, augmenting it with a noisy-channel reranking strategy to select better outputs during decoding. For Spanish to Asturian translation, our method reaches comparable BLEU scores to a strong commercial baseline translation system using only constrained data, backtranslations, noisy channel reranking, and a shared vocabulary spanning all four languages.
